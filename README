# Chinook DB ETL Project

This project aims to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from the Chinook database to create Power BI reports.

## Project Overview

The Chinook database is a sample database that contains information about a digital media store. This project will involve the following steps:

1. **Extract**: Retrieve data from the Chinook database.
2. **Transform**: Clean and transform the data to make it suitable for analysis.
3. **Load**: Load the transformed data into a format that can be used by Power BI for reporting.

## Steps

### 1. Extract

- Connect to the Chinook database.
- Extract relevant tables and data.

### 2. Transform

- Clean the data (e.g., handle missing values, correct data types).
- Transform the data to create meaningful metrics and dimensions.

### 3. Load

- Load the transformed data into a format compatible with Power BI (e.g., CSV, Excel, or a database).

## Tools and Technologies

- **Database**: Chinook Database
- **ETL Tool**: Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- **Reporting Tool**: Power BI

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the Chinook database.
3. Run the ETL scripts to extract, transform, and load the data.
4. Open Power BI and connect to the transformed data.
5. Create and publish reports.

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: Contains the ETL scripts.
- `data/`: Contains the extracted and transformed data.
- `reports/`: Contains Power BI report files.
